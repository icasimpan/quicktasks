JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a data representation standard shown in a key:value pair, just like a traditional JavaScript object.

Here's the key info you need to know about it:

* All the data in the file must be surrounded by curly braces if you're representing it as an object, and in square brackets if it is an array.
* Single quotes are not allowed
* The key in each JSON must be unique and must be in double quotes
* Numbers must not be enclosed in double-quotes, otherwise they will be treated as strings.
* The null data type must not be enclosed in double-quotes.
* Boolean values can only be true or false.
* Each key:value pair must be terminated with a comma except for the last item
* A particular object inside an array must be terminated by a comma, too.
