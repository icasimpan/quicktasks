*** draft ***

Simple OOP example and how it's done in Go adapted with some changes from [GoLangBot](https://golangbot.com/structs-instead-of-classes/).

In the root directory where you keep your golang code (e.g. ~/documents/golang), I assume you are already using the [golang init script](https://ismael.casimpan.com/quicktasks-golang/suggested-init-script-before-coding-in-golang/).
Directory layout is like the following as well.

```
├── documents/
│   └── golang/
│   └── init.sh
```

Then, within `~/documents/golang`, 
```
~$ mkdir oop
~$ git init module oop
```

Directory structure now as follows:
```
├── documents/
│   └── golang/
│   |   └── oop/
│   └── init.sh
```
