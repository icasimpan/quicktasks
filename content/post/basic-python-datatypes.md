These are the three core data types in python. Of course there are strings, int too. I'm listing this here as I often forget these:

# List
Somewhat similar to tuple (see below) but *changeable*. Uses square brackets instead of parenthesis in tuple.
```
>>> kirk = ["James Kirk", 34, "Captain", 2265]
>>> type(kirk)
<class 'list'>
```

# Tuple 
A tuple is a collection which is ordered andÂ *unchangeable*.
```
>>> mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
>>> type(mytuple)
<class 'tuple'>
```

# Dictionary
```
>>> comedian = {'name': 'Eric Idle', 'age': 74}
>>> type(comedian)
<class 'dict'>
>>> 
```
