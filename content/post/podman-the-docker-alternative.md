Yes, there's a fully opensourced version of docker and it's called `podman`.

It can be installed in other OS but what I'm showing is in WSL/Ubuntu.
```
~$sudo apt install podman
```

It's actually a drop-in replacement for Docker. See details in [this article](https://www.how2shout.com/linux/how-to-install-podman-on-ubuntu-20-04-wsl2/).
